Junior front-end developer ready for the full-time distant or not (in Węgrzce Wielkie) work. I have no commercial experience in IT sphere, but I have finished JavaScript/Front-end courses of the Rolling Scopes School and I want to continue learning and practice developing of web applications. During the learning path I have implemented several responsive web applications with vanilla JS, HTML, CSS, and now I can do this as SPA with Angular framework as well. I also have an experience in using libraries such as Bootstrap, RxJs, NgRx, etc. In addition I am not afraid of taking the responsibility so for the last school team projects I had the team lead role where one of the most important task was to setup the project from scratch using Webpack and CI/CD pipelines.
