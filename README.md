I am from Minsk, Belarus, and now I have achieved my aspiration and moved to Poland. I used to be a chemist, and after my relocation, I started my way to become an IT specialist.

I have successfully finished JavaScript/Front-end and Angular courses at the Rolling Scopes School and it took me more than one year. Thanks to this experience I have understood the basics of HTML5, CSS, and Javascript and extended these with TypeScript, Sass, and studying Angular framework as well. I also have a useful practice of using different libraries such as RxJs, NgRx, and Bootstrap and setting up projects with CI/CD pipelines from scratch.

Now I apply all my skills to create full-stack applications with SAP BTP, SAP CAP, and the flexible programming model with SAP Fiori. My goal is to extend my knowledge in this sphere and become an experienced specialist.
